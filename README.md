# Mapping NBA Shot Quality
A Data Mining project that attempts to map NBA shot attempts by their respective quality 

### Purpose:

Most people who watch basketball can, at least at basic level, understand the value of taking an open, 
corner three pointer vs. taking a long, contested, two. But what is the exact difference in shot quality? 
On average, is it advantageous to pass up a semi-open elbow jumper for a not so open, top of the key, three?
It’s these types of shot decisions that can often win or lose a game and inevitably decide the success of 
a long season. This project aims to find out which shots are more worthy of an attempt by using techniques 
in multiple linear regression analysis. In short, I aim to find the correlation between different shot locations 
and other variables (namely, the affect of the defender) to the efficiency of a shot.

For management it can be extremely helpful to accurately model the makings of a high quality shot. This can 
eventually affect coaching decisions and influence everything from play designs, defending styles, and to who 
is encouraged to take what shot. It’s also vital to hiring; it can help us fine-tune what players to pursue 
through free agency (and the draft) by telling us what traits and characteristics we should prioritize. In simple 
terms if we, as a team, taking higher quality shots than our opponent we should win most nights. But to do so,
we have to dissect the makings of a shot and find out, on average, what makes one better than another.
